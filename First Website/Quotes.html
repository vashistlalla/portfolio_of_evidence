				<li><em><strong>Charlie (Logan Lerman): </strong></em><q>I don't know if I will have the time to write any more letters because I might be too busy trying to participate. So if this does end up being the last letter, I just want you to know that I was in a bad place before I started high school, and you helped me. Even if you didn't know what I was talking about or know someone who's gone through it, you made me not feel alone. Because I know there are people who say all these things don't happen. And there are people who forget what it's like to be 16 when they turn 17. I know these will all be stories someday. And our pictures will become old photographs. We'll all become somebody's mom or dad. But right now these moments are not stories. This is happening. I am here and I am looking at her. And she is so beautiful. I can see it. This one moment when you know you're not a sad story. You are alive, and you stand up and see the lights on the buildings and everything that makes you wonder. And you're listening to that song and that drive with the people you love most in this world. And in this moment I swear, we are infinite.</q> <br /><audio src="css/media/audio/weAreInfiniteAudio.mp3" controls></audio></li>

				<li><em><strong>Patrcik (Ezra Miller): </strong></em><q>I dare you to kiss the prettiest girl in the room on the lips. And notice I charitably said girl and not person because let's face it, I'd smoke all you bitches.</q></li>
				<br />
				<br />
				<li><em><strong>Sam (Emma Watson): </strong></em><q>You can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love.</q></li>
				<br />
				<br />
				<li><em><strong>Charlie (Logan Lerman): </strong></em><q>If my Aunt Helen were still here, I could talk to her. And I know she would understand how I am both happy and sad, and I'm still trying to figure out how could that be.</q></li>
				<br />
				<br />
				<li><em><strong>Charlie (Logan Lerman): </strong></em><q>I know who you are, Sam. I know I'm quiet... and, and I know I should speak more. But if you knew the things that were in my head most of the time, you'd know what it really meant. How, how much we're alike, and how we've been through the same things... and you're not small. You're beautiful.</q></li>

				<li><em><strong>Sam (Emma Watson): </strong></em><q>Welcome to the island of misfit toys.</q></li>
