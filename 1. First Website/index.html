			<h1 id="summary">Plot Summary</h1>
			<p>Based on the novel written by Stephen Chbosky, this is about 15-year-old Charlie (Logan Lerman), an endearing and naive outsider, coping with first love (Emma Watson), the suicide of his best friend, and his own mental illness while struggling to find a group of people with whom he belongs. The introvert freshman is taken under the wings of two seniors, Sam and Patrick, who welcome him to the real world.</p>
			<h1 id="development">Development Of The Film</h1>
			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hughes_(filmmaker)">John Hughes</a> read the novel and attempted to write a screenplay after he got the rights from Chbosky; however, he never finished this screenplay. Hughes was going to use the project as a directorial comeback with more of a black comedy style. He had in mind particular actors while writing the screenplay, namely, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_LaBeouf">Shia LaBeouf</a> as Charlie, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsten_Dunst">Kirsten Dunst</a> as Sam and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Fugit">Patrick Fugit</a> as Patrick.</p>
			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Mudd">Mr. Mudd Productions</a> (producers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(film)">Juno</a>) became interested in the project and wanted Chbosky to adapt the film. The producers—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Malkovich">John Malkovich</a>, Lianne Halfon, and Russell Smith—hired Chbosky to write a screenplay adaptation (instead of Hughes) and to direct the film. Chbosky found value in half of Hughes' screenplay, so he negotiated for the rights from Hughes' heirs and added his own touches. In January 2011, Summit acquired distribution rights. The following month, Summit sought a buyer for the project at the European Film Market held simultaneously with the Berlin International Film Festival.</p>
